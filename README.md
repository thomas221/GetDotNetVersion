# GetDotNetVersion
Instructions:
Run .exe to find out the version of .NET you have

Requirements:
Only works on Windows. Requires .NET to be installed on the computer to run

Reason for only putting the .exe file in this repository:
Finding out the version of the .NET framework you have running is not that straightforward as it should be.
Console application that prints out which version of .NET you are using.
Created following the instructions on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed
Source code is basically a copy-paste from those instructions, so I'm only putting the resulting .exe here. Just adding it to my repository because I find it useful to have the .exe file available.
